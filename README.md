## Installation

After cloning the project, install the required packages with `yarn install` (or `npm install`) in the general folder and the `client` folder.

Now you're ready to get started, using the prepared task go to your client folder and use `yarn start` (or `npm start`).

If you want to use `production` use `yarn build` (or `npm build`) in the client folder and use `yarn server` (or `npm server`) in the general folder.

All the source files you need to work are in the `src` and `public` folders.

## Time investment and version

I was using `node v14.17.9` and `yarn version v1.22.19`

It took up to 6h to write the code + 1 full day of reading redux-form documentation.
